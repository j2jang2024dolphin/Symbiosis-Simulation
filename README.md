Symbiosis-Simulation

Goal: to let people know what happens with overpopulation, underpopulation, calculate ratio of species and calculate the consumption rate, reproduction rate
1. Construct an existing food web with reference to actual data on population ratio
2. Fix important population-controlling values such as rate of reproduction, rate of consumption, etc
3. Using information above, go month by month on how the population trendline occurs over x months

Offsprings are produced on a regular basis depending on reproductive cycles
Rates of consumptions are computed through the following procedures:
1. Research on actual population
2. Calculation of consumption rates that keeps this number stable

Autotroph 
Primary Consumer (deer)
Secondary Consumer (gray wolf)

Python calculates the total population by subtracting the death rate and adding the reproduction rate to the original population every year
P(n) = P(n-1) * (Rate of increase) * (Rate of decrease)
