Symbiosis-Simulation

Goal: to let people know what happens with overpopulation, underpopulation, calculate ratio of species and calculate the consumption rate, reproduction rate
1. Construct an existing food web with reference to actual data on population ratio
2. Fix important population-controlling values such as rate of reproduction, rate of consumption, etc
3. Using information above, go month by month on how the population trendline occurs over x months

off spring produced every reproducting cycle 
rate of consumption is on calculation

Autotroph 
Primary Consumer (deer)
Secondary Consumer (gray wolf)

pythn calculates the total pop by subtracting death rate, adding reproduction rate. every year. 

incorparate random function to get between 24 -> 36 
also add pup survival rate? as a percentage? 
13 packs 5.9 pups
100 wolves = 5.9 pups 
130 wolfs 5.9 * 13 pups

9-12 wolves = 4-6 pups
Reproduction rate -> 33% to 44%
Inf Mort -> about rng(1,9)
if below 2 then about 20 - 30% survive
else 70-80% survive

P(n) = P(n-1) * (Rate of increase) * (Rate of decrease)
wolves * death rate + new baby wolves (rep rate * inf.mor.rate)


1 wolf = consumes 20 deer annually

Deer to wolf ratio ~ 122 : 1
a fawn per doe (female) -> 1-2 fawn per entire population
a * (n/2) females
