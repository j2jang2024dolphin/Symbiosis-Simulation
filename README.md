Goal: to inform people what happens with overpopulation or underpopulation through a simulation

Working procedures:
1. Construct an existing food web with reference to actual data on population ratio
2. Fix important population-controlling values such as rate of reproduction, rate of consumption, etc
3. Calculate ratio of species and calculate the consumption rate, reproduction rate
4. Using information above, go month by month on how the population trendline occurs over x months

Calculations:
1. Offsprings are produced on a regular basis depending on reproductive cycles
2. Rates of consumptions are computed through the following procedures:
1. Research on actual population
2. Calculation of consumption rates that keeps this number stable

Food web levels:
1. Autotrophs (Plants)
2. Primary Consumers (Deer, Bison)
3. Secondary Consumers (Wolf, Bear)

Python calculates the total population by subtracting the death rate and adding the reproduction rate to the original population every year
Formula: P(n) = P(n-1) * (Rate of increase) * (Rate of decrease)
