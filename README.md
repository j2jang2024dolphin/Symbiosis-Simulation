# Symbiosis-Simulation
This project is a simulation game depicting symbiosis interactions among species in natural ecosystems. Organisms contributing to Yellowstone National Park's natural fauna are intertwined in a food web, causing populations to fluctuate accordingly to factors including the initial population, reproduction rates, infant survival rates, and consumption rates. The objective of this game is, upon being presented with initial populations for the wolf, the deer, the bear, and the bison, to stabilize the present ecosystem utilizing information regarding inter-species relationships without devastating it into an unsustainable state.
